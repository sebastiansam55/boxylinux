boxylinux
=========

Don't use this unless you know what you're doing in its current state. 
All that the program does right now is authenticate to box.com
via OAuth.

If you want something in a more complete state then check out my other repo [boxlinux](http://github.com/sebastiansam55/boxlinux)

Boxlinux is the base of boxylinux which is used for all of the box communication stuff.

There are some minor changes to the base of boxlinux, I may end up making a branch of it if I ever get around
to learning how to use git beyond commit push and pull.

Using this will muck with your boxlinux settings as I have made it to save the boxlinux settings in the
same file as the regular boxlinux
