Box-for-Linux
=============

Bringing Box to the Linux desktop

Project started to provide alternate way to use BOX on the Linux desktop aside from mounting the thing via webDav and all that nonsense.

It's all written in Python (pygtk) as of the moment, it's desgined for Ubuntu but it should work on most other platforms!
